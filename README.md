# Hello, world! 👋 I'm Josué Ferreyra.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate web developer with a focus on frontend development. My journey in the world of software development began as a self-taught learner, diving into bootcamps like fullstackopen and openbootcamp. Additionally, I studied software engineering for three years, where I gained a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software to further formalize my education.

I consider myself proactive, dedicated, and disciplined, always seeking to learn and grow. I love tackling new challenges and constantly improving.

## 💼 Experience
I started my career as a freelance developer in March 2023, working on various projects for local companies alongside a team of friends. Our projects include learning platforms and management systems. In January 2024, I joined Software On The Road as a Junior Software Developer, where I work with technologies like React, Typescript, Node, Express, GraphQL, SQL, MongoDB, and Sass.

## 🛠️ Skills
My specialty is the React ecosystem. I have experience with Javascript, Typescript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, BootstrapCSS, Material UI, Node.js, and Express.
